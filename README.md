🌍 Carbon Emission Prediction Project
👩‍💻 Author: Madhumitha H
📌 Project Objective:
Build a predictive model to estimate CO₂ emissions based on various socio-economic and energy-related indicators. This project helps understand which features contribute most to CO₂ emissions and how we can use ML to analyze global sustainability patterns.

📁 Project Stages:
1. Data Preparation
Loaded raw climate and emission datasets.

Cleaned missing, irrelevant, or inconsistent values.

Reshaped wide-form datasets to long-form for better processing.

2. Data Exploration
Visualized trends of CO₂ emissions over time.

Analyzed correlation between energy use, population, GDP, etc.

Performed feature engineering (per capita, per GDP normalization).

3. Model Building
Trained a Random Forest Regressor to predict CO₂ emissions.

Used train_test_split, cross_val_score, and evaluation metrics (R², RMSE).

Visualized:

Feature importances.

Actual vs. predicted emissions.

📊 Key Insights:
Energy per capita is the most important feature influencing CO₂ emissions.

The model achieved R² ≈ 0.98, indicating high accuracy.

Feature selection played a key role in reducing noise.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook

Git & GitHub

✅ Outcome:
Successfully completed all three stages:

Cleaned data 

Analyzed data 

Built and evaluated a prediction model
